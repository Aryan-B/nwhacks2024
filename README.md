# Navigate
nwHacks 2024 1Password Best Security Hack winner!

### Project Description
An all-in-one interactive map of the UBC campus where one can view the indoor accommodations (such as wheelchair accessibility) and book a study room. The maps offer navigation routes, as well as visual representations of available study rooms.

### Tech Stack
We build our project using the MERN stack. We implemented the MappedIn Maker SDK by creating a custom map of the ICICS building using floorplans, which allowed us to create custom functions to display room bookings and navigation paths. Additionally, we re-engineered the 1Password Passage authentication to include JWT authentication using HTTPOnly cookies to prevent XSS attacks. Our data is handled by MongoDB. Our project is fully protected from XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, and phishing attacks.
